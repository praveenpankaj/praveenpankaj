### Hi, I'm Praveen Pankajakshan :pray:

## About Me  

I was the Chief Scientist at [Cropin](https://cropin.com), where I led the Cropin AI Labs team. Our focus was on integrating Earth Observations and AI to revolutionize agriculture and promote sustainable land and resource use. Our multidisciplinary team includes Earth observation scientists, data scientists, and agronomists.  

Previously, I led the Data Science and Machine Learning team at Corteva Agriscience (formerly Dow-DuPont Agriculture) in Hyderabad. My experience also includes roles as a Data Analytic Scientist at Shell Technology Center Bangalore and as a Researcher and Technical Manager at Samsung Advanced Institute of Technology (SAIT).  

I currently serve as an adjunct faculty member at [AMMACHI Labs](https://ammachilabs.org) at [Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham](https://www.amrita.edu), where I advise and mentor Master's and Ph.D. students. Additionally, I am a Senior Member of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE).  

My academic background includes a Ph.D. in Control, Signal, and Image Processing from Ariana, a joint research team of INRIA, CNRS, and UNS INRIA; a Master's in Electrical Engineering from Texas A&M University; and a Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Roorkee. I was also a contractual researcher during my postdoctoral years at the Pasteur Institute in Paris.  

Beyond my professional work, I am passionate about biodiversity and practice natural and organic farming at my own farm. I am also a certified Heartfulness Meditation trainer.

## Objective  

In 2022, I recognized that scaling Natural Farming Techniques and Agroforestry requires open-sourcing all related work in agriculture, satellite imaging, science, and machine learning. I created several repositories on GitHub to provide blueprints for individuals and organizations to reproduce these methods. By sharing my experiments and learnings from my farm, [Roc Tranquil](https://goo.gl/maps/roc_tranquil), I aim to foster collective learning and avoid repeating mistakes, especially those impacting nature.
